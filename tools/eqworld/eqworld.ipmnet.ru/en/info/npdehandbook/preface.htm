a unique reference for scientists and engineers, contains over 3,000 nonlinear partial

</ul>

<p align="justify">
<b>The second edition</b> has been substantially updated, revised, and expanded.
More than 1,500 new equations with exact solutions, as well some methods and

<h2><font color=green>Preface to the first edition</font></h2>

<p align="justify">
Nonlinear partial differential equations are encountered in various fields
of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and numerous applications.

<p align="justify">
Exact (closed-form) solutions of differential equations play an important
role in the proper understanding of qualitative features of many phenomena
and processes in various areas of natural science.  Exact solutions of
nonlinear equations graphically demonstrate and allow unraveling the
mechanisms of many complex nonlinear phenomena such as spatial localization
of transfer processes, multiplicity or absence steady states under various
conditions, existence of peaking regimes and many others. Furthermore,
simple solutions are often used in teaching many courses as specific
examples illustrating basic tenets of a theory that admit mathematical
formulation.

<p align="justify">
Even those special exact solutions that do not have a clear physical
meaning can be used as <i>test problems</i> to verify the consistency and
estimate errors of various numerical, asymptotic, and approximate
analytical methods.  Exact solutions can serve as a basis for perfecting
and testing computer algebra software packages for solving differential
equations.  It is significant that many equations of physics, chemistry and
biology contain empirical parameters or empirical functions. Exact
solutions allow researchers to design and run experiments, by creating
appropriate natural conditions, to determine these parameters or functions.

<p align="justify">
This book contains more than 1600 nonlinear mathematical physics equations
and nonlinear partial differential equations and their solutions.  A large
number of new exact solutions to nonlinear equations are described.
Equations of parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptic, mixed, and general types are
discussed.  Second-, third-, fourth- and higher-order nonlinear equations
are considered.  The book presents exact solutions to equations of heat and
mass transfer, wave theory, nonlinear mechanics, hydrodynamics, gas
dynamics, plasticity theory, nonlinear acoustics, combustion theory,
nonlinear optics, theoretical physics, differential geometry, control
theory, chemical engineering sciences, biology, and other fields.

<p align="justify">
Special attention is paid to general-form equations that depend on
arbitrary functions; exact solutions of such equations are of principal
value for testing numerical and approximate methods.  Almost all other
equations contain one or more arbitrary parameters (in fact, this book
deals with whole families of partial differential equations), which can be
fixed by the reader at will. <i>In total, the handbook contains
significantly more nonlinear PDE's and exact solutions than any other book
currently available</i>.

<p align="justify">
The supplement of the book presents exact analytical methods for solving
nonlinear mathematical physics equations.
When selecting the material, the authors have given a pronounced
preference to practical aspects of the matter; that is, to methods that
allow effectively ``constructing'' exact solutions. Apart from the
classical methods, the book also describes wide-range methods that have
been greatly developed over the last decade (the nonclassical and direct
methods for symmetry reductions, the differential constraints method, the
method of generalized separation of variables, and others). For the
reader's better understanding of the methods, numerous examples of solving
specific differential equations and systems of differential equations are
given throughout the book.

<p align="justify">
For the convenience of a wide audience with different mathematical
backgrounds, the authors tried to do their best, wherever possible, to
avoid special terminology. Therefore, some of the methods are outlined in a
schematic and somewhat simplified manner, with necessary references made to
books where these methods are considered in more detail. Many sections were
written so that they could be read independently from each other. This
allows the reader to quickly get to the heart of the matter.

<p align="justify">
The handbook consists of chapters, sections, and subsections.  Equations
and formulas are numbered separately in each subsection. The equations
within subsections are arranged in increasing order of complexity. The
extensive table of contents provides rapid access to the desired
equations.

<p align="justify">
Separate parts of the book may be used by lecturers of universities and
colleges for practical courses and lectures on nonlinear mathematical
physics equations for graduate and postgraduate students. Furthermore,
the books may be used as a database of test problems for numerical and
approximate methods for solving nonlinear partial differential equations.

<p align="justify">
We would like to express our deep gratitude to Alexei Zhurov
for fruitful discussions and valuable remarks.

<p align="justify">
The authors hope that this book will be helpful for a wide range of
scientists, university teachers, engineers, and students engaged in the
fields of mathematics, physics, mechanics, control, chemistry, and
engineering sciences.
