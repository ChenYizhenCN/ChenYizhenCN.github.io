<h2><font color=green>Preface to the new edition</font></h2>

<p align="justify">
<b>Handbook of Integral Equations</b>, Second Edition, a unique reference for engineers and scientists,
contains over 2,500 integral equations with solutions, as well as
analytical and numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear equations.
It considers Volterra, Fredholm, Wiener&ndash;Hopf, Hammerstein, Urysohn, and other
equations, which arise in mathematics, physics, engineering sciences, economics, etc.
In total, the number of equations described is an order of
magnitude greater than in any other book available.

<p align="justify">
The second edition has been substantially updated, revised, and
extended. It includes new chapters on mixed multidimensional equations,
methods of integral equations for ODEs and PDEs,
and about 400 new equations with exact solutions. It
presents a considerable amount of new material on Volterra, Fredholm,
singular, hypersingular, dual, and nonlinear integral equations,
integral transforms, and special functions. Many examples were added for
illustrative purposes.
The new edition has been increased by a total of over 300 pages.

<p align="justify">
Note that the first part of the book can be used as a database of test problems for numerical and
approximate methods for solving linear and nonlinear integral equations.

<p align="justify">
We would like to express our deep gratitude to Alexei Zhurov and Vasilii Silvestrov for
fruitful discussions. We also appreciate the help of Grigory Yosifian
in translating new sections of this book and valuable remarks.

<p align="justify">
The authors hope that the handbook will prove helpful for a wide
audience of researchers, college and university teachers, engineers,
and students in various fields of applied mathematics, mechanics, physics,
chemistry, biology, economics, and engineering sciences.

<h2><font color=green>Preface to the first edition</font></h2>

<p align="justify">
Integral equations are encountered in various fields of science
and numerous applications (in elasticity, plasticity, heat and mass
transfer, oscillation theory, fluid dynamics, filtration theory,
electrostatics, electrodynamics, biomechanics, game theory, control,
queuing theory, electrical engineering, economics, medicine, etc.).

<p align="justify">
Exact (closed-form) solutions of integral equations play an important role
in the proper understanding of qualitative features of many phenomena and
processes in various areas of natural science. Lots of equations of
physics, chemistry, and biology contain functions or parameters which are
obtained from experiments and hence are not strictly fixed. Therefore, it
is expedient to choose the structure of these functions so that it would be
easier to analyze and solve the equation. As a possible selection
criterion, one may adopt the requirement that the model integral equation
admits a solution in a closed form. Exact solutions
can be used to verify the consistency and estimate errors of various
numerical, asymptotic, and approximate methods.

<p align="justify">
More than 2,100 integral equations and their solutions are given in the
first part of the book (Chapters 1&ndash;6). A lot of new exact solutions to
linear and nonlinear equations are included. Special attention is paid to
equations of general form, which depend on arbitrary functions. The other
equations contain one or more free parameters (the book actually deals with
families of integral equations); it is the reader's option to fix
these parameters. In total, the number of equations described in this
handbook is an order of magnitude greater than
in any other book currently available.

<p align="justify">
The second part of the book (Chapters 7&ndash;14) presents exact, approximate
analytical, and numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear integral
equations. Apart from the classical methods, some new methods are also
described. When selecting the material, the authors have given a pronounced
preference to practical aspects of the matter; that is, to methods that
allow effectively ``constructing'' the solution. For the
reader's better understanding of the methods, each section is supplied
with examples of specific equations. Some sections may be used by lecturers
of colleges and universities as a basis for courses on integral equations
and mathematical physics equations for graduate and postgraduate students.

<p align="justify">
For the convenience of a wide audience with different
mathematical backgrounds, the authors tried to do their best,
wherever possible, to avoid special terminology. Therefore, some of the
methods are outlined in a schematic and somewhat simplified manner, with
necessary references made to books where these methods are considered in
more detail.  For some nonlinear equations, only solutions of the simplest
form are given. The book does not cover two-, three-, and multidimensional
integral equations.

<p align="justify">
The handbook consists of chapters, sections, and subsections.  Equations and
formulas are numbered separately in each section.  The equations within a
section are arranged in increasing order of complexity.  The extensive
table of contents provides rapid access to the desired equations.

<p align="justify">
For the reader's convenience, the main material is followed by a number of
supplements, where some properties of elementary and special functions are
described, tables of indefinite and definite integrals are given, as well
as tables of Laplace, Mellin, and other transforms, which are used in
the book.

<p align="justify">
The first and second parts of the book, just as many sections,
were written so that they could be read independently from each other. This
allows the reader to quickly get to the heart of the matter.

<p align="justify">
We would like to express our deep gratitude to Rolf Sulanke
and Alexei Zhurov for fruitful discussions and valuable remarks.
We also appreciate the help of Vladimir Nazaikinskii and Alexander Shtern
in translating the second part of this book, and are thankful to Inna
Shingareva for her assistance in preparing the camera-ready copy of the
book.

<p align="justify">
The authors hope that the handbook will prove helpful for a wide
audience of researchers, college and university teachers, engineers,
and students in various fields of mathematics, mechanics, physics,
chemistry, biology, economics, and engineering sciences.
